  abstract  = {When color is used "appropriately" on a map, the organization of the perceptual dimensions of color corresponds to the logical organization in the mapped data. A color scheme typology is presented here that matches a comprehensive listing of the ways in which data are organized to corresponding organizations of hue and lightness, with secondary attention to saturation. Appropriate use of color for data display allows interrelationships and patterns within data to be easily visualized. The careless use of color will obscure these patterns. Careful use of color on maps is particularly important in interactive and animated map contexts, where the map reader must attend to changing patterns on the maps and has little time to look back and forth to a map legend, if one is offered at all. A spontaneously under- stood color scheme is a great asset in these contexts.},

  abstract     = {One of the advantages of computer graphics is that it enables an unprecedented degree of control over color. Since color vision is three-dimensional, this provides three additional perceptual dimensions that may be used in addition to the two spatial dimensions available on a flat display to present multidimensional data. This research probes the usefulness of color in enabling human observers to perceive clusters of points in a multidimensional space. Comparing the resolution of clusters in color and in space shows that color is an effective extension of space for conveying information about data dimensions. However, the perceptual space defined by color and space is not homogeneous and resolution is poor in a few specific directions. For this reason, the use of multiple views is advocated whenever color is used as a too in exploratory data analysis.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND The Lexis surface plot is an established visualization tool in demography. Its present utility, however, is limited to the domain of one-dimensional magnitudes such as rates and counts. Visualizing proportions among three or more groups on a period-age grid is an unsolved problem. OBJECTIVE We seek to extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data. METHODS We propose four techniques for visualizing group compositions on a period-age grid. To demonstrate the techniques we use data on age-specific cause-of-death compositions in France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple desired criteria. RESULTS Compositional data can effectively be visualized on the Lexis surface. A key feature of the classical Lexis surface plot – to show age, period, and cohort patterns – is retained in the domain of compositions. The optimal choice among the four proposed techniques depends primarily on the number of groups making up the composition and whether or not the plot should be readable by people with impaired colour vision. CONTRIBUTION We introduce techniques for visualizing compositional data on a period-age grid to the field of demography and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques by performing an exploratory analysis of age-specific French cause-of-death patterns across the 20th century. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the four proposed techniques. We contribute a technique to construct the ternary-balance colour scheme from within a per- ceptually uniform colour space.},

Two types of position judgments were found to be the most accurate, length judgments were second, angle and slope judgments were third, and area judgments were last.

  abstract     = {Pseudocoloring for presenting univariate map information on a graphic display system is investigated. The kinds of information available in maps are divided into two classes: metric information denotes the quantity stored at each point on the surface, and form information denotes the shape or structure of the surface. Theoretical principles are proposed to predict which color sequences will be effective at conveying value and form information respectively. According to this theory, a scale that approximates the physical spectrum should be good at conveying value information, because of the reduced effects of simultaneous contrast. It should be poor at conveying form information, however, because the brain prefers form information to come through the lightness-processing channel. Conversely, a gray scale should be poor at conveying value information and good at conveying form information, according to the same theory. These predictions are tested in a series of psychophysical experiments that test five color sequences. The results show that simultaneous contrast can be a major source of error when reading maps, but only partially confirm the form hypothesis. Guidelines are given for designing color sequences to be effective in both conveying form and value information. An experimental color sequence is presented to illustrate these guidelines},

  abstract      = {Many well-cited theories for visualization design state that a visual representation should be optimized for quick and
immediate interpretation by a user. Distracting elements like decorative “chartjunk” or extraneous information are avoided so as not 
to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may 
benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in 
various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a userʼs 
understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual 
information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual 
difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual 
difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We 
characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information 
Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which 
comprehension and recall are crucial. We identify implications of this view for the design and evaluation of information 
visualizations.},

  abstract  = {The perception of color has traditionally been characterized by the subjective dimensions of hue, brightness, and saturation. In the present study we reexamined this view by investigating whether the dimensions of color stimuli are psychologically independent in dissimilarity judgment, spontaneous classification, and instructed classification tasks. Dissimilarity judgments analyzed within the framework of the additive difference measurement model (Beals, Krantz, & Tversky, 1968; Krantz & Tversky, 1975; Tversky & Krantz, 1969, 1970) reflected violations of psychological independence for hue-chroma, hue-value, and value-chroma stimulus sets. Spontaneous classifications of each color set revealed that subjects were not sensitive to shared dimensional relations of color stimuli, but rather responded to the holistic, overall similarity relations of the stimuli. In the instructed classification task, both untutored undergraduates and "color experts" (artists specially tutored in the Munsell color system), instructed to classify according to shared dimensional relations, could extract dimensional information about either value or chroma when each was varied with hue, but could not extract dimensional information about hue. Color experts were superior to nonexperts in the extraction of dimensional information about chroma only with moderately or highly saturated stimuli. The implications of these results are considered in relation to current thinking about the perceptual organization of color and current thinking about the identification of appropriate diagnostics for independent psychological dimensions.},
